# Overview

In this module I will be creating a Flappy Bird Clone using Pygame. I am interested in making this because I liked to play Flappy Bird and because it is now unavailible this will be the only way I can play it. I am doing this to familiarize myself with Pygame and basic game creation ideas, like movement, and using a physics engine. I will be using Python as my coding language and Pygame as my coding library, I will creat all of my own art using photoshop and impliment a scoring system and sound effects.

The purpose of doing all of this was mentioned above but to elaborate I am doing this out of curiousity to get the fundamentals of game creation down and out of enjoyment, so that I can play this game again.
